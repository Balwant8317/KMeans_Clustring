Title:Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

This project focuses on customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm, which is a widely used technique for grouping similar data points together. In this case, we will cluster customers based on their annual income and spending score.

Customer segmentation is essential for businesses to better understand their customer base and tailor marketing and product strategies accordingly. K-Means clustering is a popular unsupervised learning algorithm used for clustering data points into groups based on similarity.

In this project, we will use K-Means clustering to segment customers into distinct groups based on their annual income and spending score. This segmentation can help businesses target different customer groups with tailored marketing campaigns or product offerings.
